# Coding challenge on responsiveness
[Visit me on heroku](https://boiling-earth-32826.herokuapp.com/).

## Task
Not mentioned. Just got a zip file with screens and a .sketch file.

Due within 2 hours.

## Notes
- Due within 2 hours is unrealistic for this responsive website.
- [x] Tested on Win10 with IE11 and Edge.
- [x] Tested on Ubuntu with Chrome and Firefox.
- [x] Tested on Galaxy S5. 
- No other devices at hand and not willing to pay for browserstack and such.

## Suggestions
- If the target group includes elders or people without 20/20 vision, the font size should be bigger for better readability at least on small devices.
